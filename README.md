### What and why?
Have you ever struggled with finding the best time to meet with your friends? 
Been flaked or have flaked on friends at the last minute?
Let's Meet is a web application that is designed to help users easily coordinate and plan out events.

### For whom?
This software is useful for anyone, but especially for those with busy schedules who struggle with finding a good time that works with their friends and would like to be able to manage event logistics on one platform. 

### How?
The main features of this application are:
* The end user will be able to create an account with the following information: name, phone number, email, friends, etc.
* The end user will be able to search up other users and add as a friend.
* The end user will be able to create an event draft and add information such as event title and description as well as add friends to manage and edit the event. 
    - The end user will be able to assign roles and keep track of event tasks, expenses, supplies, etc. after a time has been decided.
    - After event completion, the application will calculate and split the event cost evenly between organizers and list exact expense amounts for each person based on how much was spent on supplies.
* The end user will be able to indicate what times they are available or by importing a calendar using Google Calendar or Apple Calendar. The application will calculate overlapping free times based on times provided by users or imported calendars. It will then suggest several ideal times and users can choose the time they want.
* The end user will be able to view events that they have created and upcoming events.
* The end user will be able to export the event to their Google or Apple Calendar. 

### Scope
This project is feasible with 5 programmers. Currently there are 2 team members who are familiar with React and all team members are familiar with HTML/CSS so implementing the app features will not be too easy but will also not be too ambitious. All members are eager to learn and have prior experience with MongoDB or SQL. The scope of the project should be accomplishable within the alloted timeframe.
